According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Gino Jennings</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Gino N. Jennings (born on February 10 13th, 1963) is a Pentecostal minister from the African American community known for having been the founding pastor and the current general director of the First Church of our Lord Jesus Christ (FCOOLJC) located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.&nbsp;The Church was initially founded as a group of branch churches, which was established by Jennings in 1984.&nbsp;Today, the church’s organisation is present in a variety of locations across more than 20 states in all of the continents in United States, and around the world, and has the broadcasting of a television and radio station in Philadelphia known as The Truth of God Broadcasting Network It boasts more than 200 congregations throughout the Caribbean and across other continents like Africa, Asia, and Europe and more.</p><p align=justify>In the years 1976-78, when he was close to the age of 15 He began to preach controversial sermons about the doctrines and by-laws of his great-uncle’s beliefs to the great-uncle’s fury and surprise.&nbsp;After graduation from the high school of 1981, he started preaching against his uncle’s beliefs regarding Christian theology of sanctification, holiness and modesty in conduct, and even in dress.&nbsp;The church and the church’s management must have more strict and more biblically based guidelines for these concepts.&nbsp;He also began to preach Nontrinitarian opinions, declaring that he believed in the Trinity viewpoint of God was a lie in addition to preaching his own distinct Non-Trinitarian modalistic monarchianism.&nbsp;He also began to preach against and critiquing the positions and views that the majority of people began to adopt in churches at that time.&nbsp;His uncle then temporarily revoked the minister’s duties and forced him to go on a one-year sabbatical without preaching at the congregation.&nbsp;When he finally got the chance to speak again, he informed his uncle that he was not going to alter any of his views and beliefs.&nbsp;In 1984 at the age 21 after suffering through repeated times of being exiled from his ministry and having to have sabbaticals to preach, Jennings along with his parents , and his siblings quit the church of their great-uncle.</p><p align=justify>Between 1988 and 1989, Jennings began planting branch churches in other cities in Pennsylvania, and in other states such as Illinois, Michigan, Tennessee, Maryland, New York, and Virginia. The Services at the headquarters church in Philadelphia were moved to the auditorium of the former Hunting Park Recreation Center. In April 1989, First Church began having its services in the fellowship hall of an old Episcopalian Church building. Because the fellowship hall of the church was very large, the location provided enough room to accommodate the growing congregation. As the Philadelphia congregation exponentially grew, it was also at this time that Jennings fell in love with Darlene Gayman, a fellow member of the church whom he had been courting with. The two were married on April 15, 1989 when Jennings was 27. And to not take away from the focus of the ministry he also conducted a revival service after the wedding for the wedding guests as well.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pastor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In November 1991, Jennings and First Church purchased an 18,000 square foot church building in the Kensington section of Philadelphia on 2431 Frankford Avenue. In February 1992, just after his 30th Birthday, the new headquarters was completed and dedicated. As time passed the ministries grew and flourished, and as of June 25, 2016, Jennings made settlement on a 200,000 square foot church facility on 5105 North 5th Street in the Olney section of Philadelphia, PA. The purchase was made after the building had been pursued by the church since 2014. The facility covers a whole city block and was previously owned by the Catholic Church. It also consists of two schools, a cafeteria, an administration building, and an old convent building that was converted into lodging quarters for members that could not afford anywhere to stay during large events held at the church. The main sanctuary can fit approximately 2,300 people and the lower autitorium can fit about 1,200. This building serves as the churches headquarters to this day.</p><p>Between February and March 2018, Jennings entered the media spotlight for his controversial sermons against women wearing excessive makeup, fake hair, wigs, and jewelry in church&nbsp;; comparing women who do such things to Jezebel and Delilah. Reverend Carla Dunbar called his comments erronous and degrading. Jennings defended his statements by saying not to listen to how he sounded, but to what he said in defense of the teachings of Biblical modesty in dress and clothing. Jennings agreed to meet with Jamaican entertainer “Mr. Vegas” to debate him. However he had Vegas escorted out of the building by security after an altercation that ensued between Vegas, the church’s audio and visual team, and the other associate ministers on the pulpit. This later led to the debate going viral throughout Jamaica, and two other ministers that agreed to debate him canceled.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Gino Jennings height</b> Not available right now.

Today, the church can be found in over 20 states across the continental United States.
