He is a descendant of the rulers of Isara. At the time, Nigeria was a British colony. He is the second of seven children.&nbsp;</p><p>His siblings are <strong>Atinuke Tinu Aina Soyinka</strong>, <strong>Femi Soyinka</strong>, <strong>Yeside Soyinka</strong>, <strong>Omofolabo Folabo Ajayi-Soyinka</strong>, and <strong>Kayode Soyinka</strong>. <strong>Folashade Soyinka</strong>, his younger sister, died on her first birthday. The cultural and religious diversity of his upbringing, coupled with his early access to electricity and radio, no doubt contributed to the depth and complexity of his literary works.</p><p>As the second of seven siblings,&nbsp;<strong>Soyinka Soyinka</strong>&nbsp;was born into a family with strong ties to Nigeria’s founding fathers. His father, <strong>Samuel Ayodele Soyinka</strong>, was an Anglican minister and headmaster, while his mother, <strong>Grace Eniola Soyinka</strong>, was a political activist and devout Anglican. Despite being raised in a religious household that blended Yorùbá and Christian beliefs and practices, he eventually lost his faith as he grew older.</p><p>The religious and cultural diversity of&nbsp;<strong>Wole Soyinka</strong>‘s community, as well as his access to various forms of media, undoubtedly influenced his writing. His plays, novels, poems, and essays often incorporate elements of Nigerian folklore and mythology while also addressing pressing political and social issues. <strong>Wole Soyinka</strong>‘s incisive wit and an unerring commitment to truth and justice have earned him the esteemed Nobel Prize for Literature, making him a veritable sibyl for the African continent.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=education></span>Education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>From a young age,&nbsp;<strong>Wole Soyinka</strong>&nbsp;showed a writing talent and was awarded several prizes for his compositions while attending <strong>Abeokuta Grammar School</strong>.
