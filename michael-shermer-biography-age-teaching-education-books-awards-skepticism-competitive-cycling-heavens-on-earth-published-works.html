He has expressed reservations about such labels for his lack of belief in a God, however, as he sees them being used in the service of “pigeonholing”, and prefers to simply be called a&nbsp;skeptic.&nbsp;He also describes himself as an advocate for&nbsp;humanist&nbsp;philosophy&nbsp;as well as the&nbsp;science of morality.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=michael-shermer-age></span>Michael Shermer Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Shermer is a 65-year-old science&nbsp;writer, historian of science, founder of The Skeptics Society, and editor-in-chief of its magazine Skeptic born on September 8, 1954, in Altadena, California, United States.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=michael-shermer-family></span>Michael Shermer Family.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Shermer’s parents divorced when he was four years old, and later his father remarried, his mother with three children, who became his step-sister and two step-brothers, his father had a woman with whom he had two daughters, his half-sisters.

He then joined Pepperdine University where he received a degree in bachelor of psychology in 1976. He received his master’s degree in experimental psychology at California State University, Fullerton.</p><p>Michael Shermer specialized in Christian theology. In addition to his courses on the Bible, he studied the writings of C.S. Lewis, and he attended chapel twice a week, which was required for all students.</p><p>Despite the restrictions imposed on students, such as a ban on dancing and visiting the dorm rooms of the opposite sex, Shermer found the university a good experience, and he accepted its teachings as a valid guide for behavior.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=michael-shermer-graduate-studies-and-change-of-beliefs></span>Michael Shermer <span id=Graduate_studies_and_change_of_beliefs class=mw-headline>Graduate studies and change of beliefs</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shermer’s master’s degree in&nbsp;experimental psychology&nbsp;at the&nbsp;California State University, Fullerton, led to many after-class discussions with professors Bayard Brattstrom and Meg White at a local pub—The 301 Club—that went late into the night.</p><p>These discussions, along with his studies in&nbsp;cultural anthropology, led him to question his religious beliefs. He abandoned his devout religious views, fueled by what he perceived to be the intolerance generated by the absolute morality he was taught in his religious studies; the hypocrisy in what many believers preached and what they practiced; and his growing awareness of other religious beliefs, and how they were determined by the temporal, geographic, and cultural circumstances in which their adherents were born.</p><p>From this, Shermer came to conclude it is “obvious that God was made in our likeness and not the reverse.”&nbsp;By midway through his graduate training, he removed the Christian silver&nbsp;ichthys medallion that he had been wearing around his neck for years.</p><p>Michael Shermer completed his MA degree from California State University in psychology in 1978. The final step in Shermer’s abandoning religion came when his college sweetheart, Maureen, was in an automobile accident that broke her back and rendered her paralyzed from the waist down. Shermer relates:</p><p>When I saw her at the Long Beach Medical Center ER, the full implications of what this meant for her begin to dawn on me. There, in the ER, day after dreary day, night after sleepless night, I took a knee and bowed my head and asked God to heal Maureen’s broken back.</p><p>I prayed with deepest sincerity. I cried out to God to overlook my doubts in the name of Maureen. I willingly suspended all disbelief. At that time and in that place, I was once again a believer. I believed because I wanted to believe that if there was any justice in the universe any at all this sweet, loving, smart, responsible, devoted, caring spirit did not deserve to be in a shattered body.</p><p style=text-align:left>A just and loving God who had the power to heal would surely heal Maureen. He didn’t. He didn’t, I now believe, not because “God works in mysterious ways” or “He has a special plan for Maureen” the nauseatingly banal comforts believers sometimes offer in such trying and ultimately futile times but because there is no God.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=michael-shermer-competitive-cycling></span>Michael Shermer Competitive cycling<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Shermer got a job in writing for a bicycle magazine in Irvine, California. His first assignment, in Cycles Peugeot press conference it featured John Marino, who had just ridden from Los Angeles to New York in 13 days, one hour, and 20 minutes, made a deep impression on him.</p><p>Michael Shermer bought a bike and entered the Yoplait Yogurt 50-kilometer race through Griffith Park in Los Angeles the following weekend. His interest grew rapidly, and within a short time, he had completed his first-century ride (100 miles).</p><p>Before long he was riding hundreds of miles a week. He began competitive cycling in 1979, and he spent a decade as a professional rider. His best known bicycling is in the very long distance ultramarathon road racing discipline. He is a founding member of the Ultra Cycling Hall of Fame.</p><p>During his course in cycling, he worked with the cyler technologists in developing better products for the sport. During his association with Bell Helmets, a bicycle-race sponsor, he advised them on design issues regarding their development of expanded-polystyrene for use in cycling helmets, which would absorb impact far better than the old leather “hairnet” helmets used by bicyclists for decades.</p><p>Michael Shermer advised them that if their helmets looked too much like motorcycle helmets, in which polystyrene was already being used, and not like the old hairnet helmets, no serious cyclists or amateur would use them. This suggestion led to their model, the V1 Pro, which looked like a black leather hairnet but functioned on the inside like a motorcycle helmet.</p><p>In 1982, he worked with Wayman Spence, whose small supply company, Spenco Medical, adapted the gel technology Spence developed for bedridden patients with pressure sores into cycling gloves and saddles to alleviate the carpal tunnel syndrome and saddle sores suffered by cyclists.</p><p>During his long-distance race he helped to found the 3,000-mile nonstop transcontinental bicycle Race Across America (known as “RAAM”, along with Lon Haldeman and John Marino), in which he competed for five times (1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, and 1989), was an assistant race director for six years, and the executive race director for seven years.</p><p>His acute medical condition is named for him: “Shermer Neck” is a pain in and extreme weakness of the neck muscles found among long-distance bicyclists.

He wrote specifically about r-EPO doping, which he saw as both widespread and well known within the sport, which was later shown to be instrumental in the doping scandal surrounding Lance Armstrong in 2010.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=michael-shermer-net-worth></span>Michael Shermer Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Shermer is an American science writer, historian of science, founder of The Skeptics Society, and editor-in-chief of its magazine Skeptic who has an estimated net worth of $5 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=michael-shermer-heavens-on-earth></span>Michael Shermer Heavens on earth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In his most ambitious work yet, Shermer sets out to discover what drives humans’ belief in life after death, focusing on recent scientific attempts to achieve immortality along with utopian attempts to create heaven on earth.</p><p>For millennia, religions have concocted numerous manifestations of heaven and the afterlife, and though no one has ever returned from such a place to report what it is really like or that it even exists today science and technology are being used to try to make it happen in our lifetime.</p><p>From radical life extension to cryonic suspension to mind uploading, Shermer considers how realistic these attempts are from a proper skeptical perspective. “This book’s theme is one of the greatest practical importance to all of us: does some heaven or afterlife await us after we die? Most Americans and even many atheists believe that the answer is ‘yes.’</p><p>If there is no heaven, how can we find purpose in life? Michael Shermer explores these big questions with the delightful, powerful style that made his previous books so successful—but this is his best book.” “Heavens on Earth&nbsp;is absolutely brilliant, filled with profundity, startling facts, and mind-expanding ideas.</p><p>Michael Shermer somehow manages to be entertaining and scientifically erudite at the same time. He also brings some of history’s greatest thinkers to life and makes their ideas accessible. This is one of the most fascinating books I’ve read in a long time.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=michael-shermer-teaching></span>Michael Shermer Teaching<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While he was still cycling Michael Shermer taught Psychology 101 during evenings at Glendale Community College, which is a two-year college. Michael Shermer wanted to teach a four-year course at the university, he decided to earn his Ph.D.</p><p>Because Shermer’s interests lay in behaviorism and he did not believe he could make a difference in the world by working in a lab with Skinner boxes, he lost interest in psychology and switched to studying the history of science, he based in a full-length book on his dissertation; the book, titled In Darwin’s Shadow: The Life and Science of Alfred Russel Wallace: A Biographical Study on the Psychology of History, was published in August 2002.</p><p>His book of The Borderlands of Science, he rated on several noted scientists for gullibility toward “pseudo” or “borderland” ideas, using a rating version, developed by psychologist Frank Sulloway, of the Big Five model of personality.</p><p>Michael Shermer rated Wallace extremely high (99th percentile) on agreeableness/accommodation and argued that this was the key trait in distinguishing Wallace from scientists who give less credence to fringe ideas. He then became an adjunct professor of the history of science at Occidental College, California.</p><p>In 2007, he took a position as a senior research fellow at Claremont Graduate University. In 2011, he took a position as an adjunct professor at Chapman University and was later made a Presidential Fellow.

He wrote in the Introduction: So we are left with the legacy of two types of thinking errors: Type 1 Error: believing a falsehood and Type 2 Error: rejecting a truth.</p><p>Believers in UFOs, alien abductions, ESP, and psychic phenomena have committed a Type 1 Error in thinking: they are believing a falsehood. … It’s not that these folks are ignorant or uninformed; they are intelligent but misinformed.

In its introduction, he wrote “Never in history have so many, and such a high percentage of the population believed in God.</p><p>Not only is God not dead as Nietzsche proclaimed, but he has never been more alive.” From April 2001 to January 2019, he wrote the monthly Skeptic column for Scientific American. He has also contributed to Time magazine.</p><p>In February 2002, he characterized the position that “God had no part in the process [of the evolution of mankind]” as the “standard scientific theory”. This statement was criticized in January 2006 by the scientist Eugenie Scott, who commented that science makes no claim about God one way or the other.</p><p>In May 2002, he and Alex Grobman published their book Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?, which examined and refuted the Holocaust denial movement. This book recounts meeting various denialists and concludes that free speech is the best way to deal with pseudohistory.</p><p>Science Friction: Where the Known Meets the Unknown was released in 2005. His 2006 book Why Darwin Matters: The Case Against Intelligent Design marshals point-by-point arguments supporting evolution, sharply criticizing the intelligent design.
