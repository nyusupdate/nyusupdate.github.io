Her father was an entrepreneur. Her family was not only financially well-off but was also politically powerful.</p><p>Her grandfather, Eduardo Vallejo Varela, was a minister of economy in the Colombian government from April 12, 1930, to 7 August. Her grandmother, Sofía Jaramillo Arango, could trace her family back to Alonso Jaramillo de Andrade Céspedes y Guzmán, a nobleman from Extremadura, Spain, who could trace his own lineage back to Emperor Charlemagne.</p><p>In 1950, Vallejo and her parents moved back to Bogotá, where the births of her younger siblings, brothers Felipe (1951) and Antonio (1955-2012), and sister Sofía (1957), occurred.<br>She began her education at the kindergarten run by President Carlos Lleras Restrepo’s sister, Elvira Lleras Restrepo.</p><p>She then went on to study at the Anglo Colombian School, an institution with which she has a personal connection.

Filmed at the Medellín garbage dump, the interview garnered criticism as people thought that it humanized Escobar who, during the interview, extensively talked about his charity project Medellín Sin Tugurios (Medellin without slums).</p><p>Prior to the interview, Escobar was a minor celebrity in his country. In 1982, despite being married at the time, he reportedly declared “I want her” after seeing Vallejo on television. They met later that year and eventually became lovers. Escobar already had a reputation for his ruthlessness and bloody lifestyle. However, he could be charming and had a sense of humor. These were the qualities Vallejo found herself attracted to</p><p>As for Escobar, the relationship proved to be a useful one. The interview made him a national phenomenon. He became so popular that the newspapers started calling him “the Robin Hood of Medellín”. Whether Escobar had true feelings for Vallejo is a matter of debate. Many believed that he was simply using her to elevate himself to the national stage.</p><p>In 1987, Vallejo’s relationship with Escobar came to an end. Escobar’s son has claimed that his father cut all his ties with Vallejo after finding out that he was not her only lover. He recounted the last time he saw her. She was outside the gate of one of their estates, sobbing, while the guards of her erstwhile lover did not let her into the compound.</p><p>By the early 1990s. Escobar’s popularity and fame had considerably decreased. Vallejo did not fare any better. Escobar had a symbiotic relationship with the elites of his country. They would take his money and ignore all his illegal activities. These elites shunned her completely and she eventually vanished from the public specter.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=virginia-vallejo-death-is-virginia-vallejo-dead></span><span>Virginia Vallejo Death: Is Virginia Vallejo Dead?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>During her time with Escobar, Vallejo had witnessed his interactions with the Colombian elites.
